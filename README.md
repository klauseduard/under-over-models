# Underfitting and Overfitting in Software Development and Organizational Models

This repository started out as an attempt to analyse analogies between underfitting and overfitting as they are used in machine learning and mathematical modelling, and their applications in software development and organizational models.

## Motivation and Perspective

At its core, this work explores an insight that software engineering practices like time estimation and organizational design are modeling problems, just as software architecture, domain modeling, and machine learning are modeling problems. Each involves creating abstractions that balance simplicity against accuracy, generality against specificity.

Many aspects of software engineering draw from disciplines that practitioners may not encounter in their formal education - fields like operations research, information theory, organizational psychology, and systems theory. The author must admit that
he too has lot to discover about a number of them. By examining such interdisciplinary connections, we gain access to conceptual tools and
frameworks that can help us reason about our work at higher levels of abstraction.

This "monograph" as my AI assistant called it, uses the machine learning concepts of underfitting and overfitting as a lens through which to examine these modeling problems. By recognizing when our estimation techniques or organizational structures are too simplistic (underfit) or too rigid and specialized (overfit), we can make more conscious, informed choices about the models we adopt in our professional practice.

A further motivation is to explore how different kinds of organizations might evolve in response to AI advances, with particular focus on those producing software. Despite the increasing capabilities of AI systems in code generation and software development tasks, they do not eliminate the need for software-producing organizations. Rather, they transform how these organizations operate, shifting the nature of human contributions and potentially reshaping organizational structures, team dynamics, and development methodologies.

This exploration has practical implications: how should existing organizations adapt to AI-driven changes? What guidance should consultancies provide to clients navigating this transition? Is it more feasible to build new AI-native organizations from scratch than to transform established ones? And perhaps most importantly, how significant are AI-driven organizational changes compared to other environmental factors that organizations regularly adapt to? These questions affect not just organizational leadership, but every technology and software engineering practitioner who should be interested in what the future holds for their profession, which skills will remain valuable, and where to focus their efforts and professional development in the coming years.

Underlying this work is also an examination of the limits of compromise. The balance between underfitting and overfitting inherently involves navigating trade-offs between competing concernsâ€”simplicity versus accuracy, generality versus specificity, rigidity versus flexibility. In organizational contexts, effective compromise requires all parties to share an understanding of some fundamental principles. 

## About This Publication

### Authorship Note

Full disclosure: AI tools (Claude and Gemini) helped generate much of this content. But don't worry - a real human directed the whole show, contributed knowledge, rejected bad references, fixed missteps, and even had to wrestle with SVG layout details as you can guess from the visualizations not yet polished.

### Status

In progress. This started as something composed over a long weekend to satisfy an intellectual urge, and continues to evolve (perhaps and hopefully).
