# Underfitting and Overfitting in Software Development and Organizational Models

This repository contains a publication exploring analogies between underfitting and overfitting as they are used in machine learning and mathematical modeling, and their applications in software development and organizational models.

## Publication Status: Work In Progress

> **Note**: This publication is currently under active development. Only Chapter 2 (Software Time Estimation) is fully edited and ready for reading. Other chapters are in various stages of development and may contain incomplete content.

## Motivation and Perspective

At its core, this work explores an insight that software engineering practices like time estimation and organizational design are modeling problems, just as software architecture, domain modeling, and machine learning are modeling problems. Each involves creating abstractions that balance simplicity against accuracy, generality against specificity.

Many aspects of software engineering draw from disciplines that practitioners may not encounter in their formal education - fields like operations research, information theory, organizational psychology, and systems theory. The author must admit that
he too has lot to discover about a number of them. By examining such interdisciplinary connections, we gain access to conceptual tools and
frameworks that can help us reason about our work at higher levels of abstraction.

This "monograph" as my AI assistant called it, uses the machine learning concepts of underfitting and overfitting as a lens through which to examine these modeling problems. By recognizing when our estimation techniques or organizational structures are too simplistic (underfit) or too rigid and specialized (overfit), we can make more conscious, informed choices about the models we adopt in our professional practice.

A further motivation is to explore how different kinds of organizations might evolve in response to AI advances, with particular focus on those producing software. Despite the increasing capabilities of AI systems in code generation and software development tasks, they do not eliminate the need for software-producing organizations. Rather, they transform how these organizations operate, shifting the nature of human contributions and potentially reshaping organizational structures, team dynamics, and development methodologies.

## About This Publication

### Authorship Note

Full disclosure: AI tools (Claude and Gemini) helped generate much of this content. But don't worry - a real human directed the whole show, contributed knowledge, rejected bad references, fixed missteps, and even had to wrestle with SVG layout details as you can guess from the visualizations not yet polished.

### Development Status

This project began as intellectual exploration over a long weekend and continues to evolve. Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome!
