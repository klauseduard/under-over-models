# Plan for Improving Section 8.2.3: Potential New Failure Modes

## Current State Assessment
- Section is underdeveloped (~1 paragraph + diagram)
- Lacks empirical grounding
- Weak integration with other sections
- Missing practical implications for organizations

## Available Research Material Analysis

### Strong Empirical Evidence Available:
1. **Over-reliance/Automation Bias**: Macnamara et al. 2024 (skill decay), Carnat 2024 (EU AI Act insufficiency), Agudo et al. 2024 (confidence bias)
2. **Under-reliance**: McKinsey 2025 (28% treating AI as "experimental")
3. **Transparency**: EU AI Act Article 13 requirements
4. **Governance Gaps**: Deloitte survey data, Reuters/UNESCO findings
5. **Contrasting Evidence**: Peng et al. 2023, Pandey et al. 2024 (productivity benefits when expertise engaged)

## Step-by-Step Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Replace placeholder content with empirical evidence
**Actions**:
1. ✅ Replace theoretical assertions with Macnamara et al. 2024 findings on skill decay
2. ✅ Add Carnat 2024 analysis of EU AI Act limitations
3. ✅ Integrate Agudo et al. 2024 findings on confidence bias
4. ✅ Update references from placeholders to actual sources

**Actual delivery**: 3 paragraphs (~450 words) with core empirical evidence

### Phase 2: Balanced Perspective Integration ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Address the nuanced, context-dependent nature of these risks
**Actions**:
1. ✅ Add contrasting evidence from Peng et al. 2023 and Pandey et al. 2024
2. ✅ Explain when risks are more/less likely to manifest
3. ✅ Connect to organizational context factors
4. ✅ Emphasize that risks are "potential" not inevitable

**Actual delivery**: 2 paragraphs (~300 words) providing balanced perspective and context-dependent analysis

### Phase 3: Governance and Regulatory Context ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Connect failure modes to real-world organizational challenges
**Actions**:
1. ✅ Integrate Deloitte survey findings on governance implementation timelines
2. ✅ Add Reuters/UNESCO "sleepwalking" characterization
3. ✅ Expand EU AI Act requirements discussion
4. ✅ Link McKinsey findings on experimental treatment of AI

**Actual delivery**: 2 paragraphs (~400 words) connecting theoretical risks to practical organizational challenges

### Phase 4: Organizational Design Implications ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Connect failure modes to the chapter's core themes
**Actions**:
1. ✅ Explicitly link each failure mode to underfitting/overfitting risks
2. ✅ Connect to Conway's Law implications (prep for section 8.4)
3. ✅ Preview how these risks manifest in multi-agent systems (prep for sections 8.7-8.8)
4. ✅ Add organizational design considerations for mitigation

**Actual delivery**: 4 subsections (~600 words) providing comprehensive organizational design analysis:

## Revised Total Estimated Expansion
- Current after Phase 4: ~1,750 words + diagram
- Proposed final: ~1,900-2,000 words + enhanced visuals
- This brings it well in line with other major subsections
