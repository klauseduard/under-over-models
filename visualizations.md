# Interactive Visualizations and Tools

This page collects all the interactive visualizations, calculators, and tools available in this publication. Use these to explore concepts hands-on and experiment with different scenarios.

## Interactive Simulators and Tools

### Estimation and Planning Tools

- **[Three-Point Estimation Calculator](html/three_point_estimation_calculator.html)** - Calculate expected duration and standard deviation from optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates.

- **[Monte Carlo Project Simulation](html/monte_carlo_demo.html)** - See how Monte Carlo simulation generates probability-based forecasts for project timelines.

- **[Bayesian Project Estimation](html/bayesian_estimation.html)** - Observe how estimates evolve as new information becomes available during a project.

### Systems Theory and Entropy Tools

- **[Dissipative Systems & Organizational Dynamics](html/dissipative_sys_and_org_dynamics.html)** - Adjust variables like turbulence, resource flow, and connectivity to see how organizational systems respond.

- **[Entropy and Negentropy in Software](html/entropy_in_software.html)** - Toggle between practices like documentation and testing to see how they counteract entropy in software.

- **[Generative Entropy & Innovation Simulator](html/generative_entropy_simulator.html)** - Find the sweet spot between order and chaos that maximizes innovation potential.

- **[Long Tail Risk Visualization](html/long_and_fat_tail_risks.html)** - Manipulate risk distributions to understand their impact on project outcomes.

## Key Concept Visualizations

These static visualizations help illustrate important concepts:

### Estimation Concepts

- **[Estimation Biases](chapters/02-software-time-estimation.md#estimation-biases)** - Factors that influence optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates

- **[Under vs. Over Estimation Tendencies](chapters/02-software-time-estimation.md#three-point-estimation-practical-uncertainty-modeling)** - Common causes of different estimation errors

- **[Estimation Spectrum](chapters/02-software-time-estimation.md#bridging-simple-and-complex-approaches)** - The progression from simple to sophisticated estimation approaches

- **[Long Tail of Project Risks](chapters/02-software-time-estimation.md#long-tail-of-software-project-risks)** - How risk frequency and impact are distributed

- **[AI Productivity Variance](chapters/02-software-time-estimation.md#225-estimating-ai-assisted-development-new-uncertainties)** - How AI assistance affects development time across different task types

## Using These Tools

Each interactive tool opens in a new page. You can:
- Input your own parameters to test different scenarios
- Build intuition for complex concepts through hands-on exploration
- Apply these models to your own estimation and planning challenges
- See how changes to one variable affect overall system behavior

Experiment with different inputs to develop a better feel for how these systems behave in various situations.
