# Underfitting and Overfitting in Software Development and Organizational Models

This repository contains a publication exploring how concepts like underfitting
and overfitting as they are used in machine learning and mathematical modeling,
help us understand various problems of in software development field.

## Motivation and Perspective

At its core, this work explores an insight that software engineering practices
like time estimation and organizational design are modeling problems, just as
software architecture, domain modeling, and machine learning are modeling
problems. Each involves creating abstractions that balance simplicity against
accuracy, generality against specificity.

It also tries to demonstrate that many fields we have little time to think
about interconnect and foundational ideas exist on which practitioners rely
without much thought. Having some knowledge of such ideas informs us
about the models we are operating in, about the nature of the parameters we 
are supposed to feed into the systems, helps us to better reflect on our
doings. If we do not think of those aspects, our reflections are ritualistic
and while rituals may be valuable operational model, they may break down
once we have to adapt to changing environment.

Many aspects of software engineering draw from disciplines that we are
unlikely to think about often. Fields like operations research, information theory,
organizational psychology, and systems theory might be very relevant,
but the author must admit that some of these are only vaguely familiar.
Still, worth exploring, as by examining interdisciplinary connections,
we gain access to conceptual tools and frameworks that can help us reason
about our work at higher levels of abstraction.

This "monograph" as my AI assistant called it, uses the machine learning
concepts of underfitting and overfitting as a lens through which to examine
these modeling problems. By recognizing when our estimation techniques or
organizational structures are too simplistic (underfit) or too rigid and
specialized (overfit), we can make more conscious, informed choices about the
models we adopt in our professional practice.

A further motivation is to explore how different kinds of organizations might
evolve in response to AI advances, with particular focus on those producing
software. Despite the increasing capabilities of AI systems in code generation
and software development tasks, they do not eliminate the need for
software-producing organizations. Rather, they transform how these
organizations operate, shifting the nature of human contributions and
potentially reshaping organizational structures, team dynamics, and development
methodologies.

## About This Publication

This project began as intellectual exploration over a long weekend and
continues to evolve. It may well draw too bold parallels and interconnect
too many fields.

AI tools (Claude and Gemini) have helped to write text, find evidence, create
visualizations, and undoubtedly, see patterns some of which are actually
noise. Real human directed the show and is to blame for fantastic construts
that slipped through. Real human had to do a lot of adjusting of provided
visualizations as well, but his time was limited, so imperfections exist.
