# The Complexity Balance: Underfitting and Overfitting in Software Engineering Organizations

This publication explores how concepts of underfitting and overfitting provide an analytical framework for understanding complexity trade-offs in modern software organizations. It examines how these principles apply to software architecture, engineering processes, and technical decision-making, with particular focus on:

- System design and architectural choices
- Software development estimation and planning
- Technical organization design patterns
- AI's transformative impact on organizational practices

  <h3><a href="chapters/02-software-time-estimation.html">Chapter 2: Underfitting and Overfitting in Software Time Estimation</a></h3>
  <p>An exploration of software time estimation as a modeling problem, examining how different approaches from Bayesian methods to Monte Carlo simulation handle uncertainty. Analyzes traditional techniques (COCOMO, Function Points, Planning Poker, Expert Judgment) through the underfitting/overfitting lens, and explores how AI integration creates new estimation challenges. Introduces the concept of long-tail risk distributions in software projects.</p>

### Authorship Note

Full disclosure: AI tools (Claude and Gemini) helped generate much of this content. But don't worry - a real human directed the whole show, contributed knowledge, rejected bad references, fixed missteps, and even had to wrestle with SVG layout details as you can guess from the visualizations not yet polished.
