# 4. Stakeholder Preferences and Model Complexity

## 4.1 Management vs. Technical Specialist Preferences Through the Lens of Underfitting and Overfitting

For the purpose of this chapter, 'model complexity' refers broadly to the intricacy of designs concerning organizational structures, processes, software systems, or the information they handle, viewed through the lens of the underfitting/overfitting spectrum. More formally, organizational complexity can be understood as the amount of differentiation or variety within the elements constituting an organization, such as the number of different professional specializations required (Dooley, 2002) [^14]. The tension of overfitting/underfitting often revolves around correctly identifying and addressing what Fred Brooks termed *essential complexity*—the inherent difficulty of the problem domain—versus managing *accidental complexity* introduced by our tools and methods[^10].

When developing organizational structures and software systems, a persistent pattern emerges in the preferences of different stakeholder groups regarding model complexity. This pattern can be understood through the underfitting and overfitting framework established in previous chapters. Different stakeholders often unconsciously position themselves at different points along this spectrum based on their roles, responsibilities, and perspectives.

Management stakeholders typically favor simpler models that risk underfitting the domain complexity, while technical specialists often advocate for more detailed approaches that might risk overfitting in some contexts. These divergent positions create a productive tension that, when properly managed, can help organizations find appropriate model complexity for their specific context.

### 4.1.1 Management Preference for Simpler Models: The Risk of Underfitting

Management stakeholders, including executives, directors, and program managers, typically prefer and advocate for simpler, more standardized (organizational) models. While this approach offers significant benefits, it can sometimes lead to underfitting—creating models that are too simplistic to adequately address the complexity of the domain.

This preference for simplicity is often driven by several key factors that align with management's organizational responsibilities:

#### Cost and Resource Efficiency
Simpler models are generally less expensive to implement and maintain, requiring fewer specialized skills and less dedicated support. This aligns with management's responsibility for budgetary control and resource allocation. Research by Burton and Obel (2018) has demonstrated that managers consistently prioritize resource efficiency in organizational design decisions, particularly when facing financial constraints or competitive pressure[^1].

#### Ease of Implementation
Less complex models can be deployed more quickly and with fewer disruptions to existing operations, supporting management's focus on consistent service delivery and business continuity.

#### Scalability
Simpler, more standardized models are often easier to scale across multiple teams, departments, or business units, facilitating management's goals for organizational growth and consistency. Indeed, standardization is a recognized strategy for managing the inherent complexities of large-scale operations, as observed (even) in fields like "Big Science" [^12]. However, standardization introduces its own set of trade-offs and potential rigidities.

#### Control and Governance
Less complex models typically offer clearer oversight mechanisms and more straightforward governance structures, aligning with management's accountability for organizational performance and compliance. Empirical studies have shown that organizational complexity increases monitoring costs and reduces perceived control for management stakeholders (Burton et al., 2020)[^2].

#### Adaptability
Simpler models may appear more adaptable to changing business needs, supporting management's focus on strategic agility and organizational responsiveness.

This drive towards simplification reflects established organizational strategies for coping with complexity. Organizations often attempt to manage environmental complexity by building barriers around their core operations, smoothing input/output transactions, and adopting rules and standardized processes (Thompson, 1967, as cited in Dooley, 2002) [^14]. While effective under stable conditions, these rationalizing approaches risk underfitting when the environment is highly dynamic or the underlying technology is inherently complex.

### 4.1.2 Technical Specialist Perspective: Balancing Necessary Complexity with Simplicity

Technical specialists—including software engineers, data scientists, domain experts, and system architects—often advocate for more detailed and specialized models, but their perspective is more nuanced than simply preferring complexity for its own sake. Experienced technical specialists typically value simplicity and elegance, following principles like "the simplest solution that works" and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

However, their deep domain knowledge and technical expertise make them acutely aware of essential complexity that cannot be abstracted away without significant consequences. Their advocacy for more detailed models typically stems from a desire to address necessary complexity rather than adding gratuitous complication:

#### Essential Domain Complexity
Technical specialists, often deeply familiar with the domain, focus on ensuring the model adequately captures the *essential complexity*[^10]—those aspects of the problem domain that cannot be simplified without compromising functionality. They aim to create models that include only the minimum necessary complexity to address the problem domain effectively, while avoiding accidental complexity that adds no value.

#### Appropriate Abstraction Levels
Experienced specialists seek the right level of abstraction—complex enough to handle the required functionality but no more complex than necessary. They often follow principles like YAGNI ("You Aren't Gonna Need It") to avoid speculative complexity while ensuring the model addresses known requirements.

#### Sustainable Technical Solutions
Rather than maximizing complexity, technical specialists aim to create solutions that accurately reflect domain realities while remaining maintainable and adaptable. They may resist oversimplification when it creates technical debt or will require costly rework later, impacting long-term system viability. This focus on sustainable solutions aligns with Brooks' emphasis on *conceptual integrity*[^11], ensuring the model remains coherent and understandable despite its necessary detail. Research by Ernst et al. (2015) found that technical specialists are significantly more likely than management to identify and prioritize addressing technical debt issues, particularly architectural debt that impacts long-term system viability[^3].

#### Empirical Approach to Edge Cases
While management might view edge case handling as unnecessary complexity, technical specialists often have empirical evidence about the frequency and impact of these edge cases. Their push for handling these cases is typically based on data rather than theoretical concerns.

#### Long-term System Health
Technical specialists' concern for more detailed models often stems from experience with the long-term consequences of oversimplification, having seen how underfitting can lead to fragile systems that cannot evolve to meet changing requirements. However, it's also worth noting Brooks' caution regarding the "second-system effect"[^11], where the desire to incorporate every learned lesson or future possibility can sometimes lead specialists to introduce unnecessary (accidental) complexity, risking a form of overfitting.

From an organizational theory perspective, the specialists' focus on necessary detail can be seen as an attempt to ensure the system possesses sufficient internal variety to cope with the complexity of its environment (Contingency Theory / Requisite Variety) or its underlying technology (Perrow, 1984, as cited in Dooley, 2002) [^14][^15]. They may intuitively recognize the interdependencies that create a "rugged landscape" (Kauffman, 1995, as cited in Dooley, 2002), where simplifying individual components without understanding their interactions leads to suboptimal overall performance [^14][^16].

### 4.1.3 Different Perspectives on Complexity Value

The divergent perspectives of management and technical specialists on model complexity are rooted in fundamentally different perceptions of the costs and benefits associated with increasing complexity. The following visualization illustrates these differing viewpoints:

![Cost-Benefit Perceptions of Model Complexity](../images/complexity-cost-benefit.svg)

This visualization reveals key insights into stakeholder dynamics:

* **Management perception**: Management typically sees costs rising linearly with complexity while perceiving diminishing returns in benefits beyond a certain point. Their optimal complexity point tends to be lower on the spectrum.

* **Technical specialists perception**: Technical specialists often perceive higher long-term costs for overly simplistic models and greater long-term benefits from appropriate complexity. Their perception of both cost and benefit curves leads to a higher optimal complexity point.

* **Different optimization goals**: Management's cost concerns typically focus on implementation and operational expenses, while technical specialists emphasize long-term maintainability and adaptability costs.

* **Balanced zone**: Between these different optimal points lies a potential "balanced zone" where organizations can find compromise that acknowledges both perspectives' valid concerns.

Understanding these differing perceptions is crucial for productive collaboration as they explain why different stakeholders advocate for different positions on the complexity spectrum based on their experience and role-based perspectives.

## 4.2 Potential Conflicts and Tradeoffs

The divergent preferences of management and technical specialists regarding model complexity can lead to several potential conflicts and tradeoffs that organizations must navigate. These tensions can be understood through the lens of stakeholder salience theory (Mitchell, Agle & Wood, 1997), which explains how power, legitimacy, and urgency influence stakeholder influence on organizational decisions[^4].

### Resource Allocation Tensions
Management's focus on cost efficiency may conflict with technical specialists' desire for adequate resources to develop more sophisticated models, potentially leading to tensions in budget and resource allocation discussions. According to Mitchell et al.'s stakeholder salience framework, management stakeholders typically possess higher degrees of power and legitimacy in resource allocation decisions, which can create an imbalance in addressing technical concerns around model complexity[^4].

### Timeline Pressures
The implementation speed advantages of simpler models preferred by management may clash with the time required to develop the more detailed models advocated by technical specialists, creating potential conflicts around project timelines and deadlines.

### Quality vs. Standardization
Management's preference for standardization across the organization may conflict with technical specialists' focus on quality and specific optimizations for particular use cases, leading to debates about whether standardization or specialization should be prioritized.

### The Infrastructure Investment Tension
A particularly significant tension in software development contexts emerges around investments in technical infrastructure versus immediate feature delivery. Technical specialists often advocate for investments in abstraction layers, developer tooling, and architectural foundations that have minimal immediate customer-visible impact but significant long-term development efficiency benefits.

This creates a fundamental tension where:

- **Technical specialists** push for:
  - Building abstraction layers that simplify future development
  - Creating internal developer tools and frameworks
  - Establishing technical foundations that enable long-term flexibility
  - Refactoring existing systems to improve maintainability
  - Designing for future extensibility rather than just current requirements

- **Management** often prioritizes:
  - Delivering tangible features with immediate business value
  - Concrete customer-visible improvements
  - Meeting short-term market or business needs
  - Solutions that address current problems without "over-engineering"

This tension is particularly challenging because infrastructure investments are largely invisible to business stakeholders yet have compounding returns over time. Technical debt accumulates when these investments are repeatedly deferred in favor of immediate feature delivery, creating a pattern where development becomes progressively slower and more expensive—a phenomenon that's difficult to attribute to specific past decisions.

Empirical research by Besker, Martini, and Bosch (2019) has quantified this phenomenon, finding that development teams typically spend 23-42% of their time addressing technical debt, with management stakeholders consistently underestimating this impact compared to technical specialists[^5].

The visualization below illustrates this tension between immediate feature delivery and long-term development efficiency, showing how different perspectives lead to different investment priorities:

![Infrastructure Investment vs. Feature Delivery Tension](../images/infrastructure-feature-tension.svg)

### Long-term vs. Short-term Focus
Technical specialists might prioritize long-term system quality and maintainability, potentially at the cost of higher initial development time and resource investment, while management may focus more on short-term deliverables and quick wins, creating tensions in project planning and evaluation.

### Communication Challenges
The differing perspectives and technical vocabularies of management and technical specialists can lead to communication challenges, making it difficult to reach consensus on the appropriate level of model complexity.

### 4.2.1 Systemic Risk: Organizational Simplicity vs. Requisite Variety

The tension between management's preference for simpler organizational models and technical specialists' focus on essential domain complexity can lead to a significant systemic risk when viewed through the combined lenses of Conway's Law and Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety (as discussed in Chapters 3 and 6).

Conway's Law suggests that the architecture of a software system will inevitably mirror the communication structure of the organization that builds it. Therefore, management's pursuit of simpler organizational structures often translates directly into simpler, less complex technical architectures. This approach often aligns with what Burns and Stalker (1961) described as a *mechanistic* structure, characterized by hierarchy and specialization, typically suited for stable environments [^13].

However, Ashby's Law dictates that for a system to effectively regulate or manage a complex environment (the problem domain), the system itself must possess a sufficient level of internal variety (complexity) to match the variety of that environment. This principle of *requisite variety*, as discussed in organizational theory (Dooley, 2002, referencing Ashby), mandates that the complexity of the control system (the organization and its technical systems) must match the complexity of the system being controlled (the environment/domain) [^14]. Complex, dynamic environments often necessitate more adaptable, network-based structures—akin to Burns and Stalker's *organic* model—which frequently aligns with the needs perceived by technical specialists.

The critical synthesis emerges here: If an organization adopts a structure whose simplicity is *below* the level required by the inherent complexity of the problem domain (i.e., applying a mechanistic structure to a dynamic environment), Conway's Law implies the resulting technical system will also lack the necessary architectural complexity. By Ashby's Law (or the principle of requisite variety), such a system will be fundamentally incapable of adequately addressing the problem it is intended to solve – it is architecturally predisposed to underfitting due to organizational constraints reflecting a mismatch between structure and environment. This highlights how decisions about organizational design, driven by management preferences for simplicity, can inadvertently impose a ceiling on the technical system's ability to meet its functional requirements, creating a significant risk that requires careful balancing of stakeholder perspectives.

## 4.3 Balancing Stakeholder Perspectives

To effectively navigate the tensions between management and technical specialist preferences regarding model complexity, organizations can adopt several strategies informed by organizational design theory and stakeholder management research:

### Structured Decision-Making Processes
Implementing clear, structured processes for evaluating the appropriate level of model complexity for different contexts can help balance stakeholder preferences. These processes might include formal assessments of business requirements, technical constraints, and the relative costs and benefits of different approaches. Burton and Obel's contingency framework for organizational design provides a structured approach to evaluating complexity tradeoffs based on environmental conditions, strategic orientation, and task characteristics[^6].

### Shared Evaluation Criteria
Developing shared criteria for evaluating model complexity can help align stakeholder perspectives. These criteria might include factors such as implementation cost, maintenance requirements, scalability, performance, accuracy, and adaptability to future needs. By explicitly acknowledging the importance of both management and technical concerns, these shared criteria can facilitate more balanced decisions.

### Staged Implementation Approaches
Adopting staged or incremental implementation approaches can help bridge the gap between stakeholder preferences. For example, starting with a simpler model that addresses core requirements while planning for future enhancements to address additional complexity can satisfy both immediate delivery needs and longer-term quality concerns.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
Promoting closer collaboration between management and technical specialists can help build mutual understanding and trust, facilitating more effective negotiation around model complexity. Cross-functional teams, shared planning sessions, and joint problem-solving activities can all support this collaboration.

Mitchell, Agle, and Wood's stakeholder salience framework suggests that organizational decisions are most balanced when all relevant stakeholders have appropriate levels of power, legitimacy, and urgency in the decision-making process[^4]. Organizations can apply this framework to ensure technical specialists have sufficient "voice" in complexity decisions, particularly when they have unique domain expertise that management may lack.

### Organizational Learning and Adaptation
Treating decisions about model complexity as opportunities for organizational learning can help improve future decision-making. By explicitly reviewing the outcomes of previous decisions about model complexity, organizations can refine their approach based on actual experience rather than stakeholder preferences alone.

### 4.3.1 Complex Systems Safety Perspective on Stakeholder Tensions

The tension between management and technical specialists can be further understood through the lens of complex systems safety theory. Richard Cook's influential work "How Complex Systems Fail"[^9] provides insights that are directly relevant to the underfitting/overfitting tension discussed throughout this chapter. Several of Cook's principles illuminate why the management-technical specialist dynamic is not merely organizational politics, but reflects fundamental properties of complex systems:

#### Complex Systems Run in Degraded Mode
Cook observes that "complex systems run as broken systems"—they continue to function despite containing numerous latent failures and defects. This phenomenon explains why management and technical specialists often have different risk perceptions: 

- **Management perspective:** The system functions adequately with its current level of complexity, suggesting additional complexity is unnecessary overhead
- **Technical perspective:** The system functions *only because* technical specialists continually adapt to compensate for underlying inadequacies and latent failures

This dynamic often remains invisible until catastrophic failure occurs, at which point the technical debt and accumulated simplifications (underfitting) become apparent. Technical specialists' advocacy for appropriate complexity often stems from their direct experience with the system's degraded operation.

#### Change Introduces New Forms of Failure
Cook notes that "changes may actually create opportunities for new, low frequency but high consequence failures." This practical observation illuminates a key aspect of the management-technical specialist dynamic:

- Management stakeholders generally favor addressing known, frequent problems through simplification
- Technical specialists often warn against removing complexity that serves as protection against rare scenarios
- The value of this protective complexity remains invisible until a catastrophic failure occurs

This tension is most evident when organizations implement changes aimed at streamlining operations. While management might see only the benefits of simplification, technical specialists often recognize how simplifications can introduce new vulnerabilities or remove important safeguards against unusual circumstances.

For a deeper theoretical exploration of how this connects to long-tail risk distributions and systems theory, see Chapter 6. For our stakeholder analysis here, what's most important is recognizing that this dynamic creates opposing but valid perspectives:

- Management correctly observes that most day-to-day operations don't require the complexity technical specialists advocate for
- Technical specialists correctly identify that certain complexities, while rarely necessary, are critical for preventing catastrophic failures

This creates a persistent tension in organizations: pressure to simplify models for immediate efficiency versus maintaining sufficient complexity to defend against rare but potentially devastating failures.

#### Multiple Defense Layers and Failure Trajectories
According to Cook, "catastrophe requires multiple failures—single point failures are not enough." Complex systems develop multiple layers of defense against failure, and most potential failure pathways are blocked by these defenses. 

This perspective helps reframe the underfitting/overfitting tension:

- Management simplification efforts may inadvertently remove critical defense layers or redundancies. (This brings to mind Chesterton's fence metaphor: "Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place." Systems often contain complexities whose purposes aren't immediately obvious but become apparent only after removal.)
- Technical specialists often advocate for complexity that maintains these defense layers based on their understanding of potential failure trajectories
- Both perspectives provide important safeguards: management against unnecessary complexity and technical specialists against dangerous oversimplification

Organizations that understand this dynamic can develop more nuanced approaches to complexity, preserving critical defense layers while eliminating truly unnecessary complexity.

#### People Continuously Create Safety
Perhaps most importantly, Cook emphasizes that "people continuously create safety" and that "human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems." This highlights a critical aspect of the complexity debate:

- Technical specialists often serve as the primary adaptive mechanism in complex systems, making real-time adjustments to compensate for model inadequacies
- Their push for appropriate complexity often stems from firsthand experience with the cognitive and practical burdens of working around oversimplified processes or systems
- Oversimplified models may function only because humans are constantly adapting to fill the gaps, creating invisible cognitive load and stress. (This aligns with Team Topologies' emphasis on cognitive load as a primary consideration in organizational design — excessive simplification often transfers cognitive burden to individuals rather than eliminating it.) This phenomenon, where attempts to reduce complexity in one area inadvertently generate new complexities or burdens elsewhere, has been termed "complexity displacement" in studies of large-scale scientific organizations [^12]. Recognizing this dynamic highlights how simplification efforts, while seemingly beneficial, can shift rather than solve complexity challenges.

This principle suggests that the most effective organizational approach involves recognizing the adaptive role of technical specialists while also acknowledging management's responsibility for overall system viability and efficiency.

By incorporating these systems safety perspectives, organizations can develop a more sophisticated approach to the underfitting/overfitting tradeoff. Rather than seeing management-technical specialist tensions as merely competing preferences, they can be understood as complementary forces helping the organization navigate the inherent challenges of complex systems. This perspective allows for more productive dialogue and better-informed decisions about appropriate model complexity.

## 4.4 Visualizing Stakeholder Dynamics Around Model Complexity

To better understand the dynamics between different stakeholders and their perspectives on model complexity, the following visualizations illustrate key concepts.

### 4.4.1 Stakeholder Positions in the Complexity Matrix

![Stakeholder Perception of Model Complexity](../images/complexity-perception-matrix.svg)

This visualization places different stakeholders on a matrix defined by their perception of the value and cost of complexity. Management stakeholders typically appear in the "Low Value, High Cost" quadrant (simplicity advocates), while technical specialists often occupy the "High Value, Low Cost" quadrant (complexity champions). Middle management and other stakeholders fall between these extremes. The visualization helps illuminate how these different perceptions drive organizational tension and decision-making around model complexity.

This matrix approach is supported by research on stakeholder mapping techniques, particularly those derived from Mitchell et al.'s framework that address both the relative influence of stakeholders and their orientations toward specific organizational decisions[^7].

### 4.4.2 Key Tension Points Between Stakeholders

![Key Tension Points Between Stakeholders](../images/stakeholder-tension-points.svg)

This visualization illustrates the specific areas where management and technical perspectives most frequently encounter friction. These include resource allocation (where management seeks cost minimization while technical teams need adequate resources for sustainable solutions), timeline pressure (market timing vs. technical quality), and edge case handling (core vs. comprehensive coverage -- most common scenarios vs edge cases). For each tension point, the visualization shows both perspectives and suggests resolution strategies that balance competing concerns.

### 4.4.3 Organizational Model Balance Factors

![Balanced Decision Framework for Organizational Complexity](../images/org-model-balance-factors.svg)

This visualization uses a scale metaphor to illustrate the balancing act in determining appropriate organizational complexity. On one side are factors favoring simpler structures (speed, cost efficiency, autonomy, flow) that risk underfitting, while the other side shows factors driving more complex structures (control, compliance, scaling needs, stability) that risk overfitting. The framework identifies environmental factors that may shift the balance for specific organizations, including market volatility, company size, innovation focus, and regulatory requirements. It also highlights how AI can potentially enable simplification while maintaining coordination capabilities. This balanced approach recognizes that each organization must find its own equilibrium point based on its unique context and requirements.

Burton and Obel's contingency-based approach to organizational design supports this balanced framework, emphasizing that optimal organizational complexity depends on both internal capabilities and external environmental factors[^8]. Their research demonstrates that effective organizations adjust their structural complexity based on the specific contingencies they face rather than following universal principles about simplicity or complexity. This observed organizational behavior, where structure adapts to context, reflects the theoretical principles explored earlier, such as Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety (requiring internal complexity to match external complexity, Section 6.3), the self-organizing nature of dissipative systems responding to environmental shifts (Section 6.2), and the core tenets of sociotechnical adaptation (Section 6.6).

## 4.5 Case Examples: Stakeholder Tensions in Practice

The following case examples illustrate how the underfitting/overfitting tension between stakeholder groups plays out in real organizational contexts, showing how each perspective can be valid depending on the specific situation.

### Small Software Agency: Finding the Right Model Granularity

A small software development agency faced challenging client negotiations regarding project complexity. Management sought to standardize development processes across client projects to improve resource allocation and predictability, proposing a fixed project model with standardized phases, deliverables, and pricing. 

Technical staff, conversely, emphasized that each client project had unique requirements deserving custom approaches. They warned that a standardized model would either underserve complex projects (underfitting) or impose unnecessary overhead on simpler ones (overfitting to an "average" that doesn't exist).

In this case, **both perspectives had merit**:
- Management correctly identified that completely custom approaches for each project created unsustainable overhead and resource allocation challenges
- Technical specialists correctly identified that certain project types had essential complexity that couldn't be addressed through a standard model without significant risks

**Resolution:** The agency developed a modular project framework with:
- A core process model applicable to all projects
- Optional specialized modules for specific project types or domains
- Clear criteria for when to apply specialized approaches

This hybrid approach satisfied management's need for standardization while addressing technical specialists' concerns about oversimplification.

### Manufacturing Company: Inventory Management Complexity

A manufacturing company's inventory management system revealed similar tensions. Management pursued a simplified inventory model treating all components similarly for streamlined processes and reporting. 

Engineering and production teams highlighted that different component categories required specialized handling due to:
- Varied shelf lives and storage requirements
- Different quality control procedures
- Distinct supply chain characteristics

In this case, **technical specialists correctly identified necessary complexity**:
- Data analysis revealed that categorized inventory management reduced waste by 27%
- Quality issues decreased significantly with specialized handling procedures
- The cost of simplification would have exceeded the administrative savings

**Resolution:** The company implemented a tiered inventory model with:
- Standard processes for routine components
- Specialized workflows for critical categories
- Data aggregation maintaining simplified reporting for management

This approach balanced standardization benefits with the necessary complexity for operational effectiveness.

### Financial Services Firm: Customer Segmentation

A financial services firm debated the appropriate complexity for its customer segmentation model. The marketing department proposed a detailed 12-segment model based on sophisticated behavioral analytics and machine learning, arguing that this granularity would enable highly personalized offerings and communications.

Senior management advocated for a simpler 4-segment approach based primarily on asset levels and product usage, arguing that the more complex model would be difficult to operationalize across the organization.

In this case, **management correctly identified unnecessary complexity**:
- Implementation analysis showed most systems could only act on 4-5 segments effectively
- Staff training costs for the 12-segment model would be prohibitive
- A/B testing revealed only marginal improvement in conversion rates for the more complex model

**Resolution:** The firm adopted a hybrid approach:
- Implemented the 4-segment model for organization-wide use
- Authorized the more granular analysis for specific high-value marketing campaigns
- Established a roadmap for gradually increasing segmentation sophistication as operational capabilities matured

This approach avoided overfitting while creating a path toward greater sophistication where it could deliver measurable value.
